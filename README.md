# Win10Bot
Windows 10 IoT Robot and Framework

Win10Bot is a research project that I created to provide a solid foundation for my experiments in Robotics.
It is intended to be open for extension and rich with basic support, so that experimentation is easy.
Being a C# / Universal Windows project, it compiles to ARM architecture, and can be run on Raspberry Pi 2 under Windows 10 IoT.

Plucky The Robot is the first implementation, with hardware built around Element (a.k.a. Serializer 3.0) board.
Therefore a port of original CMRobot .NET library to Universal Windows is included in the source. 
I plan to provide an Arduino based hardware layer in the near future, as Element boards became rarity.
As any live project, this is work in progress. I publish it here in the hope that it will be useful to
my friends at RSSC.org and other Robotics enthusiasts.

Have fun and feel free to provide feedback,
